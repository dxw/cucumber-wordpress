Environment setup and step definitions for testing WordPress with Cucumber.

== Getting started

Install the gem:
  gem install cucumber-wordpress --source http://gemcutter.org

Copy the examples/features/ directory into an existing WordPress installation:
  cd wordpress-installation
  cp -R /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/cucumber-wordpress-1.0/examples/features .

Configure wp-config variables:
  vim features/support/config.yml

Run cucumber:
  cucumber

== Caveats

* The WordPress installation you're testing must be being served over HTTP
  somehow (see WEBHOST in config.yml). Eventually I want to be able to start a
  Web server from within cucumber.
* wp-config.php gets copied elsewhere and overwritten, so you can't be running
  this in a production environment.

== Patches
 
* Send me a pull request via GitHub or via email.
